# Lesson 13 - Using Namespace (Shortcut instead of writing `std::`)

In this lesson, we learn how to use the **`using namespace std;` statement** so that we don’t need to type `std::` before every standard library object.  
The goal is to make our code shorter and easier to write.

## Key Points
- Normally, you must write `std::cout`, `std::cin`, `std::string`, etc.
- With `using namespace std;`, you can just write `cout`, `cin`, `string`, etc.
- This makes code shorter and easier to read.
- ⚠️ In professional projects, developers usually avoid `using namespace std;` to prevent naming conflicts.
- 👉 In this course, we will use `using namespace std;` for **educational purposes** and **small projects** to keep things simple.
