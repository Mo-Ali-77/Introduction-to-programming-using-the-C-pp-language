# Lesson 34 - Functions Part 2  

In this lesson, we learn about **functions Part 2** in C++.  
Functions allow us to group a set of instructions together to perform a specific task, making code reusable and organized.

## Key Points
- **Definition** â†’ A function is a block of code that performs a particular task.
- A function of type void is called a procedure.
- A function of any other data type is called a Function, and it returns a value.
- We can perform mathematical calculations with any function, treating it as if it were a variable.
- A function can be called within a function.
- We can know any function of any data type such as int, float, string etc.
- A function defined from any data type other than void can return a value.
