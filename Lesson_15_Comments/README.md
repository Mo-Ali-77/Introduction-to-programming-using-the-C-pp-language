# Lesson 15 - Comments

In this lesson, we learn how to use **comments in C++** to make code easier to read and understand.  
The goal is to write notes inside the code that the compiler ignores.

## Key Points
- Comments are ignored by the compiler.
- `//` is used for **single-line comments**.
- `/* ... */` is used for **multi-line comments**.
- Good comments explain **why** the code does something, not just **what** it does.
