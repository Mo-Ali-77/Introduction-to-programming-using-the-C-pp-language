# Lesson 30 - Data Type Conversion  

In this lesson, we learn about **data type conversion** in C++.  
Data type conversion allows us to convert a value from one type to another, which is useful when performing operations between different data types.

## Key Points
- **Implicit Conversion (Type Casting)** → Automatically done by C++ when assigning a smaller type to a larger type.  
  Example: `int x = 10; double y = x;` → `y` becomes 10.0
- **Explicit Conversion (Casting)** → Done manually using `(type)` or `static_cast<type>()`.  
  Example: `double x = 9.7; int y = (int)x;` → `y` becomes 9
- **Common Uses** → Converting between integers, floats, doubles, chars, etc., to perform calculations correctly.
- ⚠️ Be careful with explicit conversions as they may lead to data loss.
