# Lesson 23 - Assignment Operators

In this lesson, we learn about the **assignment operators** in C++.  
They are used to assign values to variables, and some of them also perform operations before assignment.

## Key Points
- **Basic assignment**
  - `=` â†’ assigns a value (e.g., `x = 5;`).
- **Compound assignment operators**
  - `x += 3;` â†’ same as `x = x + 3;`
  - `x -= 2;` â†’ same as `x = x - 2;`
  - `x *= 4;` â†’ same as `x = x * 4;`
  - `x /= 5;` â†’ same as `x = x / 5;`
  - `x %= 2;` â†’ same as `x = x % 2;`
- These operators make the code shorter and easier to read.
