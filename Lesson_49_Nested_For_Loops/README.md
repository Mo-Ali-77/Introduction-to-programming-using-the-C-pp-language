# Lesson 49 - Nested For Loops  

In this lesson, we learn about **nested for loops** in C++.  
Nested loops allow one loop to run inside another, which is useful for handling multi-dimensional data and repeated tasks.

## Key Points
- A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop.
- Outer loop controls rows or major iterations; inner loop controls columns or minor iterations.
- Commonly used for multi-dimensional arrays, grids, and tables.
- Can help generate patterns or perform complex repetitive operations.
- Important for structured iteration and algorithm implementation.
