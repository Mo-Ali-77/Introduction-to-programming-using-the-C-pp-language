# Lesson 48 - For Loops and Arrays  

In this lesson, we learn how to use **for loops** to iterate over **arrays** in C++.  
This allows performing operations on multiple elements efficiently and systematically.

## Key Points
- For loops are ideal for accessing array elements sequentially.
- Can perform tasks like reading, updating, or processing array data.
- Supports nested loops for multi-dimensional arrays.
- Helps reduce code duplication when working with multiple elements.
- Essential for implementing algorithms that require array traversal.
