# Lesson 53 - Continue Statement  

In this lesson, we learn about the **continue statement** in C++.  
The `continue` statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration.

## Key Points
- Skips the rest of the code for the current loop iteration.
- Control jumps to the next iteration immediately.
- Useful for skipping specific cases while continuing the loop.
- Helps simplify conditional logic within loops.
- Commonly used in loops for input validation, filtering, or selective processing.
