# Lesson 52 - Break Statement  

In this lesson, we learn about the **break statement** in C++.  
The `break` statement allows us to exit a loop or switch-case prematurely, skipping the remaining iterations or cases.

## Key Points
- Immediately terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch.
- Useful for stopping a loop when a specific condition is met.
- Helps avoid unnecessary iterations and improves efficiency.
- Often used in combination with conditional statements.
- Can simplify control flow in loops and switch cases.
