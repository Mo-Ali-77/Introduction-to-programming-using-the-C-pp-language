# Lesson 51 - Do While Loop  

In this lesson, we learn about the **do-while loop** in C++.  
The `do-while` loop executes a block of code at least once and then repeats it while a specified condition is true.

## Key Points
- Executes code at least once, then checks the condition (post-test loop).
- Useful when the code must run at least once regardless of the condition.
- Can be used for menus, repeated input prompts, or continuous processing.
- Supports nested loops for complex iteration patterns.
- Helps in scenarios where pre-checking the condition is not desired.
